About Me

I'm Ajay, and I have a passion for teaching and helping others. Consider me your guide on the scripting journey. 
Support engineering can be challenging, but I'm here to assist you. Just like many of you, I started on the phones and developed a strong interest in automation and scripting.


Thank you for taking the time to explore my work. Everything here is open source, so feel free to use any of the resources available. Let's learn together and support each other in this journey!
